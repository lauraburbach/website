With the digitalization of communication (e.g. in social media), algorithms and artificial intelligence are influencing everyday communication for the first time. Social bots and recommendation systems change which information people get to see on the Internet. The project "Digital Maturity" deals with the question of how this change affects political opinion-forming and which competencies people need in this changed public sphere.

But what exactly does digital literacy mean?

Maturity is the capacity of inner and outer self-determination and personal responsibility. Maturity is a state of independence. Digital maturity is the ability to maintain this ability in a digitized world.

This self-chosen definition serves the junior research group as a framework for its research activities.
